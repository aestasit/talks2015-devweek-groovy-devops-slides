# Groovy DevOps in the Cloud

Slide deck of presentation "**Groovy DevOps in the Cloud**" given at **DevWeek** (London), *2015* by *Andrey Adamovich*.

Presentation description:

> In this session, Andrey will focus on a set of tools to automate the provisioning of (cloud) servers using Groovy libraries and Gradle plug-ins. He will explore how to leverage those to create an infrastructure for building, configuring and testing the provisioning of boxes in the cloud – elegant and groovy. This session will help those Java/Groovy developers interested in reusing their existing skills for infrastructure provisioning and learning more about problems encountered during system operations.
